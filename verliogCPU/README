This project was a part of my ECEGR 2220 course, Microprocessor design. The projects purpose was to create a simple verilog processor with 3 major instructions. The instructions were to add & subtract, to load a register with an input variable, and to 

This project and class was very beneficial to me. I learned about the computer architecture overall during my course, this project specifically hammered home the CPU architecture, what instruction sets are, how a control unit functions at its core, and many other concepts.

On top of the conceptual ideas, it also exposed me to hardware description langauges like Verilog and VHDL. Embedded systems, System-on-Chips, FPGAs are all things i've grown an interest in and im glad I had access to this class.
