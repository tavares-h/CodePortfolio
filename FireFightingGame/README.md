# PERSONAL NOTES
This game was my buddies idea originally, he worked / volunteered as a fire fighter. He wanted to use his expertise in the fire fighting domain to implement the fire fighting practices as the main concept of the game. He reached out to me and asked if I want to be apart of it, I agreed, thinking it would be a great experience for improving my C++ while helping out a friend.
