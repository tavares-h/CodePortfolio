    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, we explored multiple linear regression, focusing on how regularization methods like ridge regression and LASSO can improve model performance. The goal was to get hands-on experience working with regression models, both with and without regularization, using Python and the provided datasets. Throughout the process, we learned how regularization helps control overfitting by adding penalties for overly complex models, which is crucial for creating more accurate and generalizable predictions. This lab provided a practical introduction to understanding how model complexity can impact results in machine learning."

    "    From my interpretation of the scenario is that there is a total amount of sales and there are the products being sold. The correlation coefficient in this case tells us how consisent the selling of TV's match with the total amount of sales, suggesting the sales from the TV's would cover 61.2% of the total sales, and the radio's cover 33.2% of the sales. So together they would cover 94.4% of the total sales.\n",

    "2. in the california housing sheet, we have a few parameters. Location in Longitude & latitude, average age of house owner, total # of rooms across all houses, total population of that location , # of households in that location, average income of the owners+, and average value of each house. Given these parameters, I want to say the average value of a house at the location is the response variable, it seems most likely to be represented as a function of the other parameters. The median income could also be written as an equation of the parameters as a like this x + y + z + etc. would require this much income. I'll stick with the median house hold value being the response.\n",
    "3. for variables that predict the response, I want to go with total households, total population and total rooms, that would help predict the median house value. I came to this conclusion semanticly, I believe in a process of searching for a house the number of rooms would be the most conerning, ideally you want a house that has how ever many rooms you need for like work, children, etc. The total households gave me the idea of competition, this cross references with the total population too. If there are only so many households for an x population it could be increasingly competetive, so thats why i chose households and population\n",

    "5. experimentally I didn't see to much improvement in any cases, pretty negligable. They were all slightly tuned so I would say they were effected similarly. The R squared values tell us what portion of the variablity of the dependent variable is predicted/explained by the independent variable. A low R squared would mean a large portion of the dependent variables data is not explained by the independent variables. So for case one, the R is about ~.4 so the a little less than most of the data is explained. For case two, the R is 0.011 so that would mean almost none of the data is predicted by the independent. for case three, R is 0.514 so once again it predicts ~50% of the data. Finally, case four has a R of 0.518, and the three independent vareiables predict ~50% of the dependent variables data."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Through this lab, I was able to implement and compare multiple linear regression models with and without regularization. Using ridge regression and LASSO, I saw firsthand how regularization can help prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models. The results showed that while regularization can improve performance by making the model more generalizable, its effectiveness really depends on the specific dataset and problem. Overall, this lab helped me better understand the importance of managing model complexity and how regularization can play a key role in machine learning."
