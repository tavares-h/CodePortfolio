# PERSONAL NOTES
I started this project to explore the C++ socket library. I implemented a python socket connection in my capstone for controlling our data collection systems, and was inspired to learn about that concept in C++. I want to specialize in C++ and project like this exposes me to one of many domains of C++ / programming in general.
